# Keep awake  

This add-on adds a _Power Options_ submenu to the NVDA Preferences > Tools menu. The submenu has two options:
- __Keep the computer awake__: Temporarily disables power-saving mode and keeps the computer awake while the current instance of NVDA remains active. If NVDA is closed or restarted, the power-saving settings will be restored.
- __Allow the computer to sleep__: Restores the system settings, allowing the computer to enter power-saving mode.
